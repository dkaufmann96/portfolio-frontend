## Hey, I'm Daniel!

I am a software engineer at [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) ðŸš€. 

On the side, I am currently pursuing a master's degree for Software Engineering and Internet Computing at the Technical University of Vienna. 

Additionally, I am also passionate about creating open source software, this website for example is also [featured on GitHub](https://github.com/dkaufmann96/portfolio-frontend). More of my projects can be found on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dkaufmann96) and [Github](http://www.github.com/dkaufmann96).
