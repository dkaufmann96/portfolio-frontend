Tech used: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

## [JWT-Brute](https://github.com/dkaufmann96/jwt-brute)

This tool enables users to crack the key that was used to sign a given JSON-Web-Token.
This is done using a brute-force approach utilizing multiple CPU-cores.
It is mostly feasible to be used if the key consists of up to five characters, depending on your machine and the time you have available.

Only to be used for educational purposes, of course.
