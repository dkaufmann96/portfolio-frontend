# Work

Here are some projects that are/were developed during my work as a software engineer.

## [Advoodle](https://realty.advoodle.com/)

This project is the product of the startup [Advoodle Legal Tech](https://advoodle.com) and I was part of it in a senior full-stack engineer role since the founding of the business. 
The developed platform enables users to manage dynamically created contracts regarding numerous topics ranging from employment to real estate. Customers can manage entire real estate purchase/leasing processes by integrating stakeholders like estate agents and buyers into the workflow. Additionally, it allows users to manage their kyc-processes.
My responsibilities consisted of fundamental software-architecture decisions, mentoring junior developers and designing and implementing new features.

Tech stack: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## [Reposee](https://my.reposee.com/)

I worked on this project as a full-stack engineer back when I was employed at [HeBoTek](https://www.hebotek.at/home/). We developed this project for the [Reposee](https://www.reposee.com/) startup.
